# RaphaÃ«l - SPIE Chart Plugin

### What is a SPIE chart?

A SPIE chart superimposes a normal pie chart with a modified polar area chart
to permit the comparison of a set of data at two different states. This chart
type is relatively new, pioneered by Dror G. Feitelson in 2003. You can read
his original research paper [here][1].

### What browsers are supported?

Currently Firefox 4+, Chrome 11+, and Safari 5+ have been tested and verified
working. IE 7, 8, and 9 have some issues with the current implementation.

### How do I use it?

Each segment is defined in decimal percentage form. For a SPIE chart split in
half, with each half 70% full you would define 2 segments; Each with a value
of 0.5, and a fill of 0.70. All available options are described by Example 1
below.

#### Example 1

    
    
    showSpieChart({
    	radius : 100,
    	id: "example1",
    	animate: true,
    	animation: "elastic",
    	speed: 200,
    	hex: "#52718c",
    	hexfill: "#b1cce3",
    	stroke: "white",
    	segments : [
    		{value : 0.396226415094, fill : 0.12},
    		{value : 0.235849056604, fill : 0.92},
    		{value : 0.202830188679, fill : 0.56},
    		{value : 0.165094339623, fill : 1.2},
    	], 
    });

#### Example 2

    
    
    showSpieChart({
    	radius : 50,
    	id: "example2",
    	hex: "#E8DDCB",
    	hexfill: "#036564",
    	stroke: "#CDB380",
    	segments : [
    		{value : 0.214285714286, fill : 0.73},
    		{value : 0.285714285714, fill : 0.3},
    		{value : 0.357142857143, fill : 0.52},
    		{value : 0.142857142857, fill : 0.8},
    	], 
    });
